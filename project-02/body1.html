        <h2 class="body-text">Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark<mark class="punctuation">.</mark> The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting<mark>.</mark> It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing<mark>.</mark> Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark<mark>.</mark> Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun<mark>,</mark> just an unnecessary name of something<mark>.</mark> A question is a question<mark>,</mark> anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing<mark>.</mark> Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark<mark>,</mark> I always found it positively revolting<mark>,</mark> and now very few do use it. Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks<mark>,</mark> they are unnecessary<mark>,</mark> they are ugly<mark>,</mark> they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use<mark>,</mark> if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question<mark>.</mark> The same thing is true of a quotation<mark>.</mark> When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way<mark>.</mark> Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way<mark>.</mark> <br><br>
 
            So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious<mark>,</mark> and so we do not have to go any farther into that<mark>.</mark> There are besides dashes and dots<mark>,</mark> and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting<mark>.</mark> They might if one felt that way about them<mark>.</mark><br> <br>
            
            One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession<mark>.</mark> Well feel as you like about that<mark>,</mark> I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it<mark>.</mark> One does do without it<mark>,</mark> I do<mark>,</mark> I mostly always do<mark>,</mark> but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case<mark>.</mark> I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret<mark>,</mark> there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps<mark>,</mark> perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness<mark>.</mark> At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in<mark>.</mark> I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in<mark>.</mark><br><br><br><br><a href=heading2.html><mark class="arrow">â†’</mark></a></h2>
